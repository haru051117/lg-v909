# Our Mission Statement: #

---

The main reason for starting this project was to provide some kind of hope for the owners of the LG-V909 (aka LG G-Slate). Since release, the LG-V909 an 8.9 inch 4G and 3D enabled tablet manufactured by LG has been ignored by the carrier and especially the development community.

Our goal is to port CyanogenMod 9, and create an environment that is conducive to innovation for the LG G-Slate and its' variants.
