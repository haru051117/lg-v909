## APX ##
Variously referred to as APX mode, nvflash mode, or recovery mode (not to be confused with Android recovery) is implemented in ROM of the Tegra2 SoC. This means it can not be overwritten by flashing. This mode is activated by a pin on the SoC, on startup.

## Battery charging ##
If the tables is sufficiently bricked (wrong bootloader flashed?) it becomes impossible to charge the battery.
